analyzing CPU 0:
  driver: cpufreq-dt
  CPUs which run at the same hardware frequency: 0
  CPUs which need to have their frequency coordinated by software: 0
  maximum transition latency: 300 us.
  hardware limits: 300 MHz - 1000 MHz
  available frequency steps: 300 MHz, 600 MHz, 720 MHz, 800 MHz, 1000 MHz
  available cpufreq governors: conservative, ondemand, userspace, powersave, performance
  current policy: frequency should be within 300 MHz and 1000 MHz.
                  The governor "userspace" may decide which speed to use
                  within this range.
  current CPU frequency is 300 MHz.
